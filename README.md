# Tip Calculator

For this project, we need to…

- Get all of the fields.
- Listen for form submissions.
- Calculate the tip as a percentage of the total bill.
- Add the tip to the total.
- Calculate the per-person amount by dividing the total with tip among the total number of people.

*Some things to consider…*

- How do you handle dollar amounts that aren’t exactly two decimal places?
- What happens if the user forgets to provide info for one of the fields?
- How should you display the total per-person?
